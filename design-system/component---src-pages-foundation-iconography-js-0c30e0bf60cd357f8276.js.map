className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Introduction</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Iconography is an important communication tool we use to quickly\n          understand content or what is expected of us. When used correctly and\n          efficiently, these symbols allow our products to build off commonly\n          used visual metaphors to help us attach special emphasis to important\n          information and bring delight to our users.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Nuggets of Knowledge</h2>\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Icons should assist our users in navigating content faster, not\n              slow them down. If your icon is introducing confusion or\n              cluttering the page, consider other options.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Don't use too many icons, it's distracting and you may end up\n              making your content harder to understand and retain.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              When trying to think of an icon to use, take 5 seconds. If you\n              cannot think of an appropriate icon immediately, then perhaps you\n              are better off using only a label and not an icon.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Using custom icons outside of those provided by the CBP Design\n              System should be a rare use case as they add cognitive load every\n              time one is introduced. Iconography builds familiarity and quick\n              understanding by repeated exposure to your users, both on CBP\n              applications and through their broader use in society.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons when paired with text should inherit the font-size of the\n              text they are paired with. For instance if an icon is paired with\n              some body copy, it should also be size 14px.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons when paired with text should be centered aligned vertically\n              with the text.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons when paired with text should inherit the color of the\n              accompanying text, including color changes associated with changes\n              in interactive states.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons should be used in accordance with the common understanding\n              of their meaning.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              When used alone, icons should not be sized less than 20px, and\n              never smaller than 14px.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Interactive icons should have an interactive \"touch safe\" area of\n              no less than 48px by 48px, and no less than 8px of space between\n              these icons.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              System icons are always a solid, monochromatic color. Do not apply\n              gradients or convert icons to stroke only. If an icon is\n              interactive, the color applied should match its current\n              interactive state.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Altering system icons is only acceptable if you are changing the\n              core meaning of the icon, and most importantly a more appropriate\n              icon does not already exist in the library. Redundant, and\n              inconsistent iconography hurts the whole enterprise ecosystem, not\n              just your application.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              When developing native applications, you should use the CBP Design\n              System icons inside the application unless the application is\n              calling a native function of the device. In this instance use the\n              native device's default iconography where appropriate.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              In the case of icons being used to convey meaning and not just\n              decorative (semantically), you need to apply any relevant Aria\n              labels, title, and alternative text describing its purpose and\n              current interactive state if applicable.\n              {/* @TODO: Add link to relevant section in Reference and Research Section */}\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Font Awesome</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          The CBP Design System uses the Font Awesome 5 library of icons.\n          Specifically we only use the free tier solid and brand offerings.

Below you will find\n          the most commonly used icons and their intended use cases. This list\n          is organized by the icon's individual affordance level. An affordance\n          in this context is the perception people have with an object and how\n          that thing is to be used.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          This is by no means a comprehensive list. These are just the most\n          commonly used icons listed here for your convenience with some added\n          UX guidance on how these icons are used across the CBP enterprise.\n          Should you encounter a need not fulfilled here, before you venture\n          into the territory of creating a custom icon, please consult the Font\n          Awesome site here to view a complete listing of their offerings. Make\n          sure to have the free filter selected as the CBP Design System only\n          uses the free tier of their offering.

They should be used for very narrow use cases and\n          not substituted for other icons. Most of the time, these icons may be\n          used without supporting text.

Obviously they cannot\n          replace the written word, we don't use a pictographic language like\n          the ancient Egyptians after all. Icons can however act as a way to\n          effectively communicate a concept, object, or action in a very\n          economic amount of space. Icons themselves are a form of illustration\n          that through time builds upon repeated exposure to create a common\n          meaning. Icons should be immediately understood by your users. If they\n          are not intuitively understood then they are no longer adding value\n          but hurting the overall usability of your product. When used correctly\n          icons can enhance your product by allowing your users to quickly scan\n          the page and boost retention and legibility of your content.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Affordances</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          n the past, interfaces for digital products used designs that very\n          closely related to the physical world. Buttons looked like real,\n          physical buttons with complex gradients and pressed states that\n          mimicked the action of pressing an actual button. This skeuomorphism\n          (digital designs that mimic the real world) provided a bridge the\n          physical world that people were accustomed with interacting with to\n          the digital world. Over the years, people have become comfortable with\n          these concepts, and simplified, abstract versions of these interface\n          elements work just as good or better. This familiarity is what we\n          refer to as an affordance. The user because of prior, repeated\n          exposure intuitively knows what a particular element's purpose is and\n          what is expected of them to interact with it.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          With iconography these associations can have very fixed, explicit\n          relationships, or very loose, implicit relationships. For example the\n          save icon, also known as a floppy disk, pretty much has one, explicit\n          meaning. Save. If a user sees this symbol they know almost immediately\n          what its purpose is. They need little to no guidance to understand\n          what is expected of them when they see it. And for this reason it\n          should only be used in this context. This tight matrix with its\n          meaning also allows for it to stand alone with no supporting text and\n          still have the user understand what to do.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Other icons however may have several implicit, or not obvious,\n          meanings depending on its context. They may, or may not, require\n          further explanation to the user. This is where user testing is so\n          important. As developers and designers we must understand while we can\n          certainly empathize with our users, we are not necessarily our users.\n          When trying to use a non-explicit icon without supporting text, you\n          should be doing testing to see if your users can actually understand\n          what that icon means on its own or if the user gets lost or confused.\n          Icons should help users navigate faster not slow them down.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n          Product Icons vs. Illustrations vs. System Icons\n        </h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Pictorial elements like icons and illustrations can provide your\n          layouts with landmarks that delight users and reinforce the narrative\n          you are trying to convey. There are three main categories that are\n          pertinent here: Product Icons, System Icons, and Illustrations.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Illustrations</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Illustrations serve a couple of use cases. They can be purely\n          decorative, or more importantly, they use imagery to explain complex\n          ideas, visualizations, or narratives. Illustrations represent content\n          rather than just complementing it.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Product Icons</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Product icons are the elements that serve as branding for a particular\n          system, application, or service. This is most evidently shown in home\n          screen icons for native apps on mobile devices. Their purpose is to\n          help a user quickly select a tool from a group of tools or to\n          reinforce connection to the brand that tool represents. For example\n          this product icon may be used on both the home screen of a mobile\n          device but also may show up in another application as a way creating a\n          quick visual connection to that brand, and possibly serve as a\n          landmark link to that application, system, or service. Do not use\n          common system icons as product icons.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">System Icons</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Unlike product icons and illustrations, system icons are intended to\n          be more concise, simple, and to the point in regards to their meaning.\n          They are designed for reuse across not just a single product, but\n          across the enterprise. They derive value in this repeated exposure, so\n          our user base builds their connection to this imagery over time.\n          System icons are functional in nature and help break down information\n          on the page to make it more scannable, and reinforce overall\n          hierarchy. These icons should bring clarity to the function they are\n          highlighting, keeping their design simple helps reinforce this. If the\n          icon applied does not bring clarity to the function it is describing,\n          it likely should be removed in favor of text label.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          When we use the term icon in this documentation we are referring\n          specifically to system icons. We will add guidance for product icons\n          and illustrations at a later date.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">When to use an icon</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Choosing when to use an icon can be a tricky and subjective decision.\n          Sometimes there is an urge to overuse them in an effort to create\n          layouts that are more visually appealing. What ends up happening\n          however, is instead of enhancing the content on the page, you end up\n          creating a \"Where's Waldo\" painting. Products should be very judicious\n          in their use of iconography.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n          Icons will never be able to compete with a label\n        </h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Labels will always be more effective than icons. People just don't\n          have the bandwidth to remember tons of different icons and their\n          particular meaning inside your product. Remember that people use\n          digital products other than yours, and are exposed to very similar\n          looking elements that may have disparate meanings. Because very few\n          icons are used universally, not just across our enterprise but across\n          digital products in general, a label will always offer more clarity.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Why use an icon at all if labels are more effective? Icons offer a few\n          key pieces of value. In some instances icons can help bridge language\n          barriers. They improve the overall aesthetic of your product.\n          Throughout a product, the use of an icon consistently can improve\n          scan-ability and quickly give users clues to functionality. Most\n          importantly they can reinforce informational hierarchy. They can grab\n          a user's attention, direct them, inform users what information is\n          important, and let them know in what order content should be consumed.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Using an icon in partnership with a label however, has a positive\n          effect that often is greater than using either the icon or the label\n          individually. The icon provides the visual landmark to help users\n          quickly find a common function or idea, and the label provides the\n          context so that we can be sure the user understands what that icon\n          means. 9 times out of 10, when using an icon this will be the optimal\n          situation that provides the best value to the user. Does every label\n          need an icon though? No. Remember icons should be used judiciously.\n          Use them to pull special attention to specific elements on the page,\n          not to decorate.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          When using an icon inline with a label the icon should always appear\n          to the left of the label. The icon must be synonymous with the label\n          in color, presentation, and match the current state of the label so\n          they are associated together. For example, if the label is a\n          particular color that represents a hover state, the icon should follow\n          with this particular property.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">The 5 Second Rule</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          When considering using an icon, take 5 seconds and think about what\n          icon is most appropriate for use in the context you are trying to use.\n          If you cannot immediately think of an icon thats appropriate then you\n          are probably better off not using one, and a simple label will likely\n          be more effective.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Custom Use</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In some instances you may have a product that has a particular action\n          or function that reappears often and may be quite important, but does\n          not have a readily associated icon. This might be an opportunity to\n          introduce an icon from the Font Awesome or CBP Design System icon\n          libraries to help your users identify an important function, provided\n          you use this icon in conjunction with a label.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Using an Icon on Its Own</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There are a few icons that are as close to universal as you can find.\n          The much maligned \"hamburger\" (three horizontal bars) icon that\n          symbolizes a menu, save, play, etc. These icons may be stylized\n          differently from product to product, but they generally have a similar\n          appearance and are used in a consistent context. These \"high\n          affordance\" icons can normally be used on their own without a label\n          because users are very familiar with them already. You should still be\n          seeking to validate that this is true from time to time with your user\n          testing.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          When building responsive products you might find that in the act of\n          condensing a layout to fit on smaller form factors that dropping a\n          label from its icon is a much more efficient use of space. Be careful\n          when conducting user testing to make sure that this difference in\n          layout is not disruptive, is still consistent in use and placement,\n          and of course is still understandable by the end user.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Over time with enough exposure you might find that during user testing\n          that an icon outside of this \"high affordance\" category has built up\n          enough familiarity to live on its own. But be wary that the data truly\n          bares out that the user has become familiar with the icon's purpose,\n          and not just its location in the page. You may find that changing the\n          icon's location may confuse users. This is a good indication that they\n          have really just memorized that function's location and that the icon\n          still needs a label to be properly understood.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Keep it Simple. Keep it Consistent.</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Icons are often ineffective in the context of very abstract ideas,\n          this is where the realm of illustration plays its role. Make sure that\n          in places where you are utilizing icons that the idea or function they\n          are meant to resemble is simple and easily understandable with little\n          context.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          More important than anything else though is consistent use. Don't use\n          a heart icon to symbolize the act of favoriting an item in one place\n          and a star in another. Remember that your users are exposed to a\n          multitude of applications within our enterprise, and that your use of\n          an icon is also consistent in what your user might encounter in\n          another CBP application.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Why Font Awesome?</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Our previous effort, the CBP Theme 1.X, used version 4 of Font\n          Awesome. We made the decision to upgrade to version 5 because the of\n          their decision to redesign their icons at a bigger size, which allows\n          for more detailed and cleaner icons, as well as more icons to choose\n          from in their free tier.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Why Font Awesome instead of other free offerings like that of Material\n          Icons? One of the main tenets of the CBP Design System is to build\n          bridges to the CBP Theme and we felt staying with Font Awesome would\n          aid in the transition process for our development teams. Font Awesome\n          also offers some useful solutions for our development teams currently\n          using version 4 to easily upgrade to version 5 using shims. Please see\n          documentation on their website here for more information.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          That being said, we realize that Font Awesome does contain a lot of\n          extraneous icons that are unnecessary for our uses and does not\n          include some key icons that are useful for a government and law\n          enforcement agency. In these instances a custom icon will be necessary\n          to fulfill this need. From time to time, we will add custom icons to a\n          repository outside of the Font Awesome library that will be usable by\n          any team using the CBP Design System.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          A note on endorsement.

This font relies on ligatures to call\n          icons. For example if you have some text formatted with the font\n          awesome free font in a solid weight and you type the phrase\n          \"arrow-circle-down\" the words will automatically be replaced with the\n          appropriate icon from the library. This works in most word processors\n          and graphics software like Sketch™ and the various Adobe Creative\n          Suite software applications.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          <a href=\"#\">\n            Download the font here\n            {/* @TODO: Download font link */}\n          </a>\n        </p>\n\n        <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Installing on your PC (Windows 10):</h4>\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Unzip the folder containing the fonts first.

Normally, in your HTML file you can call Font\n          Awesome icons inline by inserting them into an <code>{`<i>`}</code>tag\n          (semantic HTML tag for icons) and the icon's prefix and name. We only\n          include the free \"solid\" and \"brand\" weights of this webfont so those\n          prefixes are \"fas\" and \"fab\" respectively.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">For example:</p>\n        <CodeSnippet\n          code={`<i class=\"fas fa-camera\"></i>\n<i class=\"fab fa-font-awesome\"></i>`}\n          language=\"language-html\"\n        />\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Icon Sizing</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Icons, just like typography, are a communication tool. They have to be\n          legible. Because they are not as ubiquitous as the letters in our\n          alphabet, they need to be a little larger than a standard letter to be\n          understood. That being said, icons need to be legible at a range of\n          sizes.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          By default, Font Awesome icons are set to 1rem. In our case 14px. You\n          can see that in general an icon that is rectangular might occupy space\n          that spans to top of an ascender to the bottom of a descender in our\n          Roboto font. When using an icon inline with a text label, the icon\n          should inherit the sizing of that text. Icons should never be sized\n          below 14px. (sorry subheads no icons for you). When using icons on\n          their own, use the font-size property to assign sizing.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Icon Spacing</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Icons that perform a purely decorative function and are not\n          interactive should follow general spacing guidelines found on the\n          Layout, Grid, and Spacing foundations page here. Obviously the bigger\n          the icon is the more weight and importance it is given. Icons that\n          perform an interactive function however, must meet minimum \"touch\n          safe\" sizing restrictions. The icon itself may be smaller, but the\n          interactive area must be at a minimum 48px x 48px and maintain a\n          minimum distance from other interactive elements of 8px. See the\n          Interactivity foundations section for more information about \"touch\n          safe\" principles.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Decorative Icons</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          When icons are not associated with an interactive function, ie you\n          click them and nothing happens, we will consider them to be\n          \"decorative.\" In this sense they serve the purpose of enhancing an\n          area of content to assist in building the overall hierarchy of the\n          page. Sometimes this might mean using Font Awesome icons, or it might\n          mean using stylized .svgs made custom for your product. Make sure that\n          their use here enhances the layout and helps direct your users in the\n          intended flow, not just there for the sake of aesthetics. There is a\n          lot more subjectivity here about what to use in what context. It\n          really depends on the context you are using it in. Developers should\n          be wary though of using high affordance iconography though in a\n          non-standard use case. This will hurt their value in the long run and\n          may add confusion to your product. Also, if the icon you are using is\n          not interactive, be careful to not stylize them as if they are\n          interactive, or colored in a way that would give cues to a user that\n          this element is interactive. This too will introduce unnecessary\n          confusion. Otherwise this is an area to bring some personality to your\n          product much like a custom illustration would.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Placing an icon onto a shape</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There are several ways of boosting an icon's visual presence on the\n          page usually involving increasing its size. Sometimes though you may\n          want to take things a little further especially if that icon is\n          interactive. Placing an icon onto a shape like a circle or rounded\n          square to further accentuate its importance can be a viable option. In\n          situations where you might have a few icons on the page and you really\n          want to pay special attention to a particular icon (especially if it\n          is used by itself with no label). Placing an icon onto a shape can\n          raise its profile. Like with iconography in general you must be\n          judicious in this use case. Having every icon on a shape dilutes its\n          power. Be wary of the shape you choose as well. Certain shapes have\n          meaning already attached to them. Triangles are indicators of a\n          warning, octagons are associated with stop, etc. Please follow\n          guidance found in the button component page here for icons that you\n          are placing on a shape that are interactive.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">When to Create a Custom System Icon</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          If your product has a function that is sufficiently important,\n          consistently featured, but does not seem to readily have an\n          appropriate icon available; it may be time to consider creating a\n          custom icon.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In making your custom icon; do not skew, italicize, or otherwise alter\n          Font Awesome Icons unless its new meaning is different than the\n          standard icon and an appropriate icon for this meaning does not\n          already exist in Font Awesome or the CBP Design System custom icon\n          libraries.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Make sure you ask yourself if the icon is really necessary before you\n          craft one. With each icon you introduce, you are increasing cognitive\n          load on your users.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Designing your Custom System icon</h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          First download this template. Icons should be exported as .svgs to\n          allow them to scale better. Try not to use raster-based icon formats\n          like .png, .gif, or .jpg.\n        </p>\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Icons should feel balanced. This is not to say symmetrical, but\n              they should not appear awkwardly lop-sided. Sometimes optical\n              balance is more important than mathematical balance. Use your best\n              judgement when sizing different elements of your icon.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icon design should be more \"fill focused.\" It should not overly\n              rely on stroke elements to define its form unless a stroke based\n              form would indicate a change in interactive state. Filled vs.\n              empty star icons are a good example. Stroke heavy icons tend to\n              not scale down as well.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons should feel crisp, clean, and concise. This will help its\n              better integrate with existing iconography and not seem out of\n              place. Icons should be efficient at moving a user towards task\n              completion and minimize the time to comprehension. If they are not\n              clear or take a while to decipher what exactly the visual metaphor\n              you are trying to create is, they will hurt your product instead\n              of enhancing it.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons are built off of a 16px grid initially. Elements within the\n              icon should align evenly to pixels and not use percentages or half\n              tones to create its form. This will help it scale efficiently\n              without having to worry to much about aliasing issues. Please use\n              the template file when starting to build your icon.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              You custom icon should not attempt to replace an existing icon in\n              our libraries. Consistent use across the enterprise is of\n              paramount importance. Redundant iconography hurts the entire\n              enterprise ecosystem, not just your product.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons should be designed in the most abstract way possible while\n              balancing the need for recognition. Simple Icons are more legible,\n              scale better, and fit within the existing iconography choices.\n              Icons should be bold and use geometric shapes whenever possible.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              CBP Design System icons favor rounded corners most of the time\n              unless rounding a corner would hurt the icon's recognition. This\n              applies to both the shape and any strokes that appear on the icon.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons should have a consistent stroke width and stroke terminals.\n              Strokes should be aligned to the interior of the shape in most\n              cases, use your best judgement. But never align strokes to the\n              center of the object as this will cause the strokes to align to\n              half pixels. The minimum stroke width on iconography is 2px. When\n              exporting your .svg remember to expand your strokes.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons should be forward-facing and not be in 3-dimensional\n              perspective unless that is absolutely necessary for its meaning.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              System icons are monochromatic. They do not have gradients,\n              multiple colors, different colors for the fills and strokes, or\n              other types of treatments.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Icons do not have drop shadows or other like effects applied.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              When you introduce custom iconography you should do user testing\n              from time to time to reconfirm that its introduction is not\n              distracting or confusing your users.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Perferred SVG Format</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          It is preferable when you are creating your icons to use a vector\n          lossless format. Meaning it will scale without any discernible loss of\n          detail. In general .svg (scalable vector graphics) is the preferred\n          format. It's a little different from other vector formats like .eps in\n          that it actually based on an XML-based markup language. Normally these\n          files are smaller and leave open the possibility to do a lot of\n          editing right in the browser.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Designing your Product Icon</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">Guidance Coming Soon.</p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Illustration General Principles</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">Guidance Coming Soon.</p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Animating Icons</h2>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">Guidance Coming Soon.</p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Accessibility</h2>\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n          Decorative vs. Semantic Uses of Font Awesome Icons\n        </h3>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">There are two basic uses for iconography.</p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Decorative icons help give your product better visual hierarchy, may\n          help explain certain concepts, and serve as visual landmarks on your\n          page. They do not have interactive functions or provide relevant\n          information to the user not already found on the page. Providing a\n          title or alt text for these images is unnecessary. Redundant icons\n          such as icons that are used in conjunction with a text label that do\n          not add pertinent information would fall into this category. For\n          screen reader compatibility add an empty alt tag to this image to have\n          the reader skip over them.\n        </p>\n        <CodeSnippet\n          code={`<i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-car\" alt=\"\"></i>\n`}\n          language=\"language-html\"\n        />\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Semantic icons convey information that may not be garnered simply by\n          reading the accompanying text on the page, or provides interactive\n          functionality. Each icon should be accompanied by either assistive\n          text or aria-label. For static icons, use the title attribute to\n          describe the meaning of the icon not what it looks like. For example,\n          the printer icon would be \"print\" not printer. For interactive icons,\n          use the aria-label attribute to describe the meaning of the icon's\n          current state.\n        </p>\n\n        <CodeSnippet\n          code={`<a href=\"path/to/shopping/cart\" aria-label=\"View 3 items in your shopping cart\">\n  <i aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fas fa-shopping-cart\"></i>\n</a>`}\n          language=\"language-html\"\n        />\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In either case, it is important that the aria label:\n          <code> Aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> is attached to our{\" \"}\n          <code>{`<i>`}</code> elements because it will keep the awkward\n          situation where screen readers actually read out the Font Awesome name\n          for the icon instead of its intended use.

It is well-tested, even if not fully featured. The\n          type scale is mostly consistent with one noticeable blip when moving\n          from Heading 2 to Heading 1. There were also some great strides in\n          improving performance removing extraneous file types and moving the\n          font files to a CDN to allow caching in later iterations. While this\n          was a great start there are some significant issues however. There is\n          little to no variability in font weight (light, regular, bold) in the\n          different heading levels, and with the combined even and small step\n          difference between headings, hierarchy can be difficult to\n          distinguish. There some noticeable oversights in not optimizing line\n          height, line length, and other micro-typography settings to enhance\n          legibility.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          The existing type-scale follows a more traditional diatonic format\n          (think Microsoft word or email editors), which normally moves up the\n          scale in a “step-like fashion”. Starting with adding 1px between\n          steps, then 2px, and so forth. Always with even steps. Ours has some\n          noticeable differences at the ends of the scale. +3 at the beginning\n          and +6 at the top create a disturbance in that natural progression.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n          <em>\n            Theme 1.x is located here:\n            <a href=\"https://us-cbp.github.io/cbp-style-guide/docs/index.html\">\n              {\"\"}\n              https://us-cbp.github.io/cbp-style-guide/docs/index.html.\n            </a>\n          </em>\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n          Building a Bridge to the CBP Design System.\n        </h2>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          It is a certainty that there will be a length of time where both the\n          CBP Theme 1.X and the CBP Design System will be in use across the\n          enterprise concurrently. In order to create some synergy between them,\n          and not create a visual schism between different applications until\n          they can update to the Design System, we have made design decisions to\n          make this transition as smooth as possible while bringing more modern\n          techniques into the fold. The proposed typography changes, while\n          having a lot in common with the CBP Theme 1.X, will be a significant\n          move forward for the enterprise and constitute a system-breaking\n          change. This was a big part of the decision we made to create a new\n          Design System rather than continue to iterate in place.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">\n          Roboto.

Near\n          the end of the theme 1.X life cycle we introduced the Roboto Mono\n          weight for tabulation, eliminated superfluous type files, and moved\n          our font files to a CDN solution. To maintain consistency for our IE\n          users we will continue to offer the .woff file type, but will focus on\n          the .woff2 as it is widely accepted in modern browsers.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2 className=\"cbp-heading-2\">Crafting a balanced system.</h2>\n\n        <figure>\n          <img\n            src=\"https://betterwebtype.com/assets/img/triangle/triangle-paragraph-explained.jpg\"\n            style={{\n              width: \"350px\",\n            }}\n          ></img>\n          <figcaption className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n            Source:{\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://betterwebtype.com/triangle/\">Better Web Type</a>\n          </figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body padding-bottom\">\n          In his book, \"A Better Web Typography\", Matej Latin proposes that for\n          optimal legibility, the “holy trinity” of font size, line-height, and\n          line length all need to be in “balance.” If any of the 3 have too much\n          dominance then your users may have issues reading any text over 2 or 3\n          lines.

In dense\n          applications you want a smaller type scale and settings that reflect\n          the hierarchy needed to make that flow work (productive). In more\n          informationa l sites like blogs a larger ratio exists between type\n          steps (Expressive).\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In productive sites the relationship between elements on a page\n          becomes a lot more important because it impacts the intended\n          work-flow. Therefore having wild gaps in type steps may cause too\n          great a disruption when re-flowing the page between breakpoints and\n          across devices.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In expressive sites the pages usually have a lot more text content and\n          may rely more heavily on size relationships to create hierarchy and\n          pull special emphasis to certain type areas. Having smaller text\n          across the board in an editorial style site can actually hurt\n          legibility because the hierarchy may not be immediately discernible.\n        </p>\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In a system that may need to exist across these boundaries do we\n          maintain two different sets of type scales and special type classes\n          for each side of the coin? Or do we maintain a consistent set of\n          standards regardless of site purpose? Usually the simplest answer is\n          best. For now we present a single set of typographic choices with a\n          the addition of two\"Masthead\" type classes to help account for the\n          instances in which we need larger typographic choices.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a scale.</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There are 8 main scales that typographic systems employ. These range\n          from 1.067 (Minor Second) through 1.618 (the Golden Ratio). Three of\n          these systems are suitable for use in productive systems like CBP\n          develops. The rest have much more severe changes between hierarchical\n          levels and are only really suitable for expressive type systems. This\n          limits are selection to testing on Minor Second (ratio of 1.067),\n          Major Second (ratio of 1.125), and Minor Third (ratio of 1.2).\n        </p>\n\n        {/* @TODO: image of scale comparisons */}\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a base font size.</h3>\n\n        {/* @TODO: image of arms length comparisons maybe */}\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There have been a lot of studies in recent years about what the\n          optimal base copy size should be. Most browsers and the big names in\n          tech like Google&trade; pretty much unanimously decreed 16px as the\n          best body copy size (for mobile). This is all relative to the distance\n          from the viewport to your eyes. Much like how the\"standard\" size for\n          body copy in books is around 12pt. That choice is related to the\n          average distance a book is legible by a person with average eyesight\n          at arm's length. This same principle applies to products like\n          billboards which must be legible at a great distance and often at high\n          speeds. In this case this means that text must be much bigger by\n          comparison in order to remain legible.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          In an enterprise like CBP where the number of devices a digital\n          product can appear on continues to grow beyond traditional desktop\n          computers into mobile devices, wearables, and large wall- mounted\n          displays we have to craft a system that remains legible in different\n          sorts of scenarios.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Is the industry standard 16px right for our needs? In the case of\n          these studies they want to remain relevant in a world that is\n          increasingly mobile-first so the recommendation of 16px is directly\n          related to viewing content on mobile handheld devices and the\n          distances generally associated with holding them. But these studies\n          are also more centered on expressive type applications and sites.\n          Productive systems (which are the vast majority of CBP systems) are\n          much more space- conscious, and much more sensitive to wild swings in\n          responsive behavior when reflowing content up and down the viewport\n          width range.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          This gives a little flexibility when choosing a base font size that\n          fits our particular needs as an enterprise. During our initial\n          research, we tested a range of base font sizes from 13px (the CBP\n          Theme 1.X base font size), through the industry standard 16px to see\n          how this might affect a typical application design. Remember we want\n          to build bridges to systems that were originally built with the CBP\n          Theme. What we found was that our old 13px system just didn't hold up\n          legibility wise, and 15px and 16px size effectively broke layouts and\n          did not reduce as well on smaller breakpoints. That made our decision\n          easy because only 1 option was left, 14px. A fitting compromise since\n          it's not that far off from the existing 13px setting and gets us\n          closer to the industry standard 16px.

Earlier we established that our body copy will\n          be 14px. It’s a good industry standard practice to use a 4px baseline\n          grid meaning all spacing will be a multiple or factor of 4 (almost all\n          device viewport widths are in multiples of 4 for some reason). 20px\n          for the Body Copy line-height seems to be a good fit. This is legible\n          and gives a good starting point for our spacing system (for more\n          information on the spacing system please see its section under\n          foundations).\n          {/* @TODO: [**The Baseline Grid image line height body copy + good rhythm bad\n            rhythm image**] */}\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Line Height Exploration</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Line-height in digital design is the space which one line of text\n          occupies. In print design this line goes from the line of which\n          lower-case letters rest to the baseline of the next line of text. In\n          digital design however, this line falls directly between lines of\n          text. Earlier we arrived at a line- height of 20px for our body copy.\n          Now we need to set line-height values for our other type classes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Headings should rarely have many lines of text (if you do then you\n          should reconsider this copy). So in order to keep them from appearing\n          as if they are drifting apart with their increased size, you need to\n          decrease line height to around 1-1.2 times font size (it’s subjective\n          we will have evaluate two values for each heading optically). A\n          heading of 24px would result in line height of 24-29. We have also\n          established our 4px baseline grid so we know that our line-height\n          values will have to be rounded up the nearest multiple of 4. In this\n          case 24px or 32px.\n          {/* @TODO: **image of heading table and differences in line height\n            understanding between web and print instances**] [**images for line\n            height exploration**] */}\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n          How spacing affects hierarchy in typography.\n        </h3>\n\n        {/* @TODO: image showing bad vs good spacing relationships */}\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-bpdy\">\n          The “Law of Proximity” states that when objects are close to each\n          other they tend to be perceived together as part of a group. Applying\n          the RIGHT spacing value between different elements is important\n          because it creates, or breaks a contextual bond. The closer they are\n          together the more likely they are interrelated, and conversely the\n          further they are apart the less they are connected.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          With this in mind, we need to create a hierarchy that is able to\n          communicate a few things with our typography.

It's partly to do with how our eyes work mechanically,\n          but also just how we scan content. There have been many studies on\n          this subject where a general rule of between 45-85 characters fits the\n          typical users needs. Any longer and it can be tiring on our eyes. Any\n          shorter and reading comprehension can suffer because sentences no\n          longer flow naturally. If lines are too long, readers tend to\n          accidentally read the same length multiple times (also known as\n          \"doubling\"). Essentially this has to do with our body copy classes as\n          this should be the only instances where we are dealing with long\n          blocks of text and multiple paragraphs. Headings should be limited in\n          length by their very nature.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          We can control control line length in two ways; the container width\n          and the max-width property. When we think of responsive layouts, text\n          boxes are aligned to a number of grid columns. In a situation where a\n          block of paragraph text is in the context of a large screen, assigning\n          col-12 (essentially full screen) would not be a great idea. The line\n          length would just be too long. Choosing a smaller amount of columns\n          like 4 or 5 would be much more reasonable and would result in a much\n          better measure. When the viewport gets to a smaller form factor like\n          phones, the text box should be 4-col (full screen) by default as\n          anything less would just be too short and would result in the user not\n          having a great experience. For our body copy classes we have built in\n          a safety mechanism with assigning a max-width of 75em. Why em? Because\n          line length essentially has nothing to do with our root settings and\n          everything to do with the exact type class we're working with.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n          <em>\n            Learn more about the CBP Design System's grid settings under the\n            <a href=\"./layouts\"> Spacing, Grid & Layout section</a> in\n            foundations.{\"\"}\n          </em>\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n          Columns, Paragraphs, and Logical Reading Order\n        </h3>\n\n        <h4 className=\"cbp-heading-4\">Logical Reading Order</h4>\n\n        {/* @TODO:  [**image of what logical reading order / maybe eye F patterns**]*/}\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          People naturally read content in a certain pattern in western\n          civilizations. We start at the top-left of the page and read\n          left-to-right down the page.

Pages essentially can scroll infinitely. We\n          recommend you go through each of the major breakpoints (see more in\n          the Spacing, Grid, and Layout section of foundations) and address the\n          following questions:\n        </p>\n\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Would it be frustrating for the user read a single long column of\n              text and have to scroll a long ways back up the page to get to the\n              next relevant area of the page?\n            </li>\n            <li>Does the order of your content make sense?</li>\n            <li>Are you keeping line length principles in mind?</li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n\n        {/* @TODO: [**image of logical reading order**] */}\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Letter Spacing</h3>\n\n        {/* @TODO: [**image explaining why this is important** */}\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          The spaces between the letters are just as important as the words\n          themselves. While reading, the spacing betweenindividual letters (aka\n          kerning) and words is super important. If the kerning is too tight,\n          letters may overlap and generally legibility is hindered. Too far\n          apart and words start to blend together. The Font-kerning property\n          applies certain amounts of space between individual character\n          combinations. For example, when capital V and A are next to each\n          other. In general we keep this property set to “normal” which means it\n          applies tighter kerning at larger sizes and not on smaller sizes, but\n          they also don’t have a consensus about where these boundaries are\n          across browsers. In general we try to control these settings with the\n          letter-spacing property. Letter- spacing (also known as tracking)\n          applies space between characters uniformly. For body copy we keep this\n          set to normal, as this will allow ligatures to appear. As the sizing\n          of our heading classes grows however, negative letter-spacing may be\n          added to keep characters from drifting from each other.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Alignment</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          Alignment refers to which vertical axis type is aligned to.

This is not to mention that we effectively forced our\n          development teams to self-host a copy. For our internal CBP\n          development teams we host centralized copies of our font files so\n          everything can be accessed once and allow our users to be able to\n          properly cache these files.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          We support two font file types.

The conversion of dp units to screen\n          pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi / 160). For example, on a 240 dpi\n          screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels.

To get a\n          comprehensive view of how we approach accessibility in the CBP Design\n          System please see that section in the foundations area. You should be\n          aware of the following concepts when working with typography in the\n          CBP Design System:\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">\n          Using Semantic Elements to identify blocks of text.\n        </h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          No matter which elements you are adding to your pages, the correct\n          corresponding semantic HTML element should always be utilized.\n          Properly tagging text elements on the page will allow assistive\n          technologies to correctly interpret all the information on the page.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n          <strong>WCAG Details</strong>\n          1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A Information, structure, and\n          relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically\n          determined or are available in text. 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence Level A\n          When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a\n          correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Maintaining Proper Heading Structure</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          The headings on your page should be semantically tagged and appear in\n          descending order. Theoretically, there should only be a single H1\n          element on the page (the first item present in your page’s main\n          content UI region). Headings should not skip a level in descending\n          order (h1 > h2 > h3 > h4 > h5 >h6). Sibling heading elements should\n          use the same level semantic tag. The heading styling classes are named\n          to be synonymous with the semantic heading structure. For example h1\n          should be paired with heading1, h2 with heading2, etc. This is with\n          the notable exception of the masthead classes which are designed to\n          stand in for heading 1 when you have a need to style your page’s title\n          more flamboyantly. The reason we do not style the semantic tags\n          directly is because we have a need to create more than one version of\n          a heading class depending on its contrasting background color.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n          <strong>WCAG Details</strong>\n          1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A Information, structure, and\n          relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically\n          determined or are available in text. 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence Level A\n          When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a\n          correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Consistency of Presentation</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          This is basically when you are styling two items of equal weight in\n          your content. For example, you have two text elements (h3 for example)\n          on the page that are siblings. These h3 elements must be styled\n          identically. Doing so means using the same font-weight, color, and\n          other styling attributes.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-subhead-text\">\n          <strong>WCAG Details</strong>\n          1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A Information, structure, and\n          relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically\n          determined or are available in text. 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence Level A\n          When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a\n          correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.\n        </p>\n\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Line Height, Line Width</h3>\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          WCAG 2.0 accessibility rules state that there should be a least 1.5x\n          line height when one paragraph immediately follows another. In this\n          case, our line height for body copy is 20px and therefore the spacing\n          between paragraphs must be at least 32px (rounded up from 30px to\n          match our baseline grid). We also implement a 75em max-width\n          restriction on body copy to comply with maximum character\n          requirements.

You need another visual cue\n          that explains what meaning that color is trying to represent. Making\n          that text into a heavier weight like bold and italicizing it would be\n          sufficient however (as long as this approach is consistent across the\n          enterprise). In order to keep text legible, text should meet minimum\n          contrast ratios with the color around it.

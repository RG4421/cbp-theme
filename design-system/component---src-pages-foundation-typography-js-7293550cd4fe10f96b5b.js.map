It is well-tested, even if not fully featured. The\n          type scale is mostly consistent with one noticeable blip when moving\n          from Heading 2 to Heading 1. There were also some great strides in\n          improving performance removing extraneous file types and moving the\n          font files to a CDN to allow caching in later iterations. While this\n          was a great start there are some significant issues however. There is\n          little to no variability in font weight (light, regular, bold) in the\n          different heading levels, and with the combined even and small step\n          difference between headings, hierarchy can be difficult to\n          distinguish.

In dense\n          applications you want a smaller type scale and settings that reflect\n          the hierarchy needed to make that flow work (productive). In more\n          informationa l sites like blogs a larger ratio exists between type\n          steps (Expressive).\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          In productive sites the relationship between elements on a page\n          becomes a lot more important because it impacts the intended\n          work-flow.

Having smaller text\n          across the board in an editorial style site can actually hurt\n          legibility because the hierarchy may not be immediately discernible.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          In a system that may need to exist across these boundaries do we\n          maintain two different sets of type scales and special type classes\n          for each side of the coin? Or do we maintain a consistent set of\n          standards regardless of site purpose? Usually the simplest answer is\n          best. For now we present a single set of typographic choices with a\n          the addition of two \"Masthead\" type classes to help account for the\n          instances in which we need larger typographic choices.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <br />\n\n      <section>\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a scale.</h3>\n        <br />\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There are 8 main scales that typographic systems employ.

The rest have much more severe changes between hierarchical\n          levels and are only really suitable for expressive type systems. This\n          limits are selection to testing on Minor Second (ratio of 1.067),\n          Major Second (ratio of 1.125), and Minor Third (ratio of 1.2).\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        {/* @TODO: Delete after content is received */}\n        <strong style={{ color: \"red\" }}>\n          [**image of scale comparisons**]\n        </strong>\n      </section>\n\n      <br />\n\n      <section>\n        <h3 className=\"cbp-heading-3\">Choosing a base font size.</h3>\n        <br />\n\n        {/* @TODO: Delete after content is received */}\n        <strong style={{ color: \"red\" }}>\n          [**image of arms length comparisons maybe**]\n        </strong>\n\n        <br />\n        <br />\n\n        <p className=\"cbp-body\">\n          There have been a lot of studies in recent years about what the\n          optimal base copy size should be. Most browsers and the big names in\n          tech like Google&trade; pretty much unanimously decreed 16px as the\n          best body copy size (for mobile). This is all relative to the distance\n          from the viewport to your eyes. Much like how the \"standard\" size for\n          body copy in books is around 12pt. That choice is related to the\n          average distance a book is legible by a person with average eyesight\n          at arm's length. This same principle applies to products like\n          billboards which must be legible at a great distance and often at high\n          speeds. In this case this means that text must be much bigger by\n          comparison in order to remain legible.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          In an enterprise like CBP where the number of devices a digital\n          product can appear on continues to grow beyond traditional desktop\n          computers into mobile devices, wearables, and large wall- mounted\n          displays we have to craft a system that remains legible in different\n          sorts of scenarios.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Is the industry standard 16px right for our needs? In the case of\n          these studies they want to remain relevant in a world that is\n          increasingly mobile-first so the recommendation of 16px is directly\n          related to viewing content on mobile handheld devices and the\n          distances generally associated with holding them. But these studies\n          are also more centered on expressive type applications and sites.\n          Productive systems (which are the vast majority of CBP systems) are\n          much more space- conscious, and much more sensitive to wild swings in\n          responsive behavior when reflowing content up and down the viewport\n          width range.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          This gives a little flexibility when choosing a base font size that\n          fits our particular needs as an enterprise. During our initial\n          research, we tested a range of base font sizes from 13px (the CBP\n          Theme 1.X base font size), through the industry standard 16px to see\n          how this might affect a typical application design. Remember we want\n          to build bridges to systems that were originally built with the CBP\n          Theme. What we found was that our old 13px system just didn't hold up\n          legibility wise, and 15px and 16px size effectively broke layouts and\n          did not reduce as well on smaller breakpoints. That made our decision\n          easy because only 1 option was left, 14px. A fitting compromise since\n          it's not that far off from the existing 13px setting and gets us\n          closer to the industry standard 16px.

Earlier we established that our body copy will\n          be 14px. It’s a good industry standard practice to use a 4px baseline\n          grid meaning all spacing will be a multiple or factor of 4 (almost all\n          device viewport widths are in multiples of 4 for some reason). 20px\n          for the Body Copy line-height seems to be a good fit.

In print design this line goes from the line of which\n          lower-case letters rest to the baseline of the next line of text. In\n          digital design however, this line falls directly between lines of\n          text. Earlier we arrived at a line- height of 20px for our body copy.\n          Now we need to set line-height values for our other type classes.\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          Headings should rarely have many lines of text (if you do then you\n          should reconsider this copy). So in order to keep them from appearing\n          as if they are drifting apart with their increased size, you need to\n          decrease line height to around 1-1.2 times font size (it’s subjective\n          we will have evaluate two values for each heading optically). A\n          heading of 24px would result in line height of 24-29.
